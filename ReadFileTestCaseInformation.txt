✅ 1. Dynamic DOM & duplicate elements
 
The same element (like profile name in hamburger menu) appeared multiple times in the DOM (id duplicated or rendered in two places).
 
Needed more specific locators or XPath with indexing to target the right one.
 
✅ 2. CSS selectors not working reliably
 
@FindBy(css = "#hmenu-customer-name b") was ambiguous because of duplicate elements and hidden DOM sections.
 
Had to switch to more robust XPaths or context-based locators.
 
✅ 3. Unexpected pages disrupting flow
 
Sometimes after login you hit the "Continue Shopping" page (<button class="a-button-text">Continue shopping</button>).
 
Needed logic to detect this page and handle it before continuing the flow.
 
✅ 4. Oops / 503 Service Unavailable page
 
After clicking login, Amazon sometimes shows:
 
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Oops! It's rush hour and traffic is piling up...
Required additional checks (verifyNoOopsPage()) and logic to stop execution gracefully instead of continuing tests.
 
✅ 5. Timing restrictions
 
Some test scenarios only valid in certain time windows (like 6 PM–7 PM, 3 PM–6 PM).
 
Had to implement conditional checks in code to skip outside those windows.
 
✅ 6. Profile name validation logic
 
Needed to validate that the extracted profile name does not contain certain forbidden characters (A, C, G, I, L, K).
 
Handling string trimming, case-insensitive checks, and edge cases (empty or unexpected names).
 
✅ 7. Username / profile element on homepage vs hamburger menu
 
Initially, you were checking after clicking the hamburger menu (profileNameElement), but then discovered a better stable locator on the home page (homeProfileElement with id nav-link-accountList-nav-line-1).
 
✅ 8. Payment and cart validations
 
Payment logic was not performed
 
✅ 9. Asynchronous page loads
 
Amazon’s dynamic nature required explicit waits (WebDriverWait with ExpectedConditions) to avoid stale element exceptions and ensure elements were visible/interactable.
 
✅ 10. Handling hidden elements
 
The hamburger menu and profile details were sometimes present in DOM but hidden (display:none), causing confusion in element selection.
